        The first will unfollow everyone who did not follow back within 12h.
        The second one will unfollow the followers within 24h.


        Bonus Tip: If you want to unfollow people who havenot followed you back.
        change InstapyFollowed=(True,"nonfollowers") to InstapyFollowed=(True,"nonfollowers")

                session.unfollow_users(amount=500, InstapyFollowed=(False, "nonfollowers"),
